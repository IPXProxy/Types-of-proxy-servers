A proxy IP is an intermediary server that hides a user's real IP address. a VPN, as a networking tool, can also act as an intermediary between a user and a website, and while it shares some common features with a proxy IP, there are significant differences. This article will delve into the differences between proxy IPs and VPNs.

<h3>Definition of Proxy IP</h3>
Proxy IP acts as a gateway between the Internet and the user, and it has its own IP address. Users use the IP address of the proxy server to send requests to the target website, and then the proxy server will return the acquired data to the user. In this process, the target website only knows the IP address of the proxy server, and the real IP address of the user is hidden.

<h3>Definition of VPN</h3>
VPN is virtual private network, usually the VPN gateway adopts a dual network card structure, the external network card using the public IP access to the Internet. it can establish an encrypted tunnel between the user and the server, that is, the establishment of a private network on the public network, encrypted communication. When the user uses the VPN, the traffic will be transmitted through this encrypted tunnel, thus guaranteeing the security and privacy of the data.

<h3>Difference between Proxy IP and VPN</h3>

Proxy IP and VPN have in common that they can hide the user's real IP address and provide a secure browsing environment for the user. However, there are still some key differences between them, mainly reflected in the following aspects:

**1. Security** 

Proxy IP is mainly used to protect the user's security and hide the user's real identity. The level of security provided by proxy IPs depends on the protocol they use, so it is best to use the proxy IP service of a proxy service provider. High-quality proxy service providers usually support HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols, which can effectively guarantee users' security.

A VPN encrypts user data and users can browse the web without having to share their IP addresses and other data. Of course, people should also choose a quality VPN service provider when using a VPN. They usually have protocols such as OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKev2, L2TP/IPsec, etc., which can provide better security for users.	

**2. Speed** 

Proxy IP can speed up network access because proxy servers are usually located in geographically close nodes. Users can choose a proxy IP for a specific region, which not only speeds up the connection, but also allows access to different resources.

VPNs are slower compared to proxy servers. Since VPNs require encrypted data and VPN nodes are usually used by more than one person, this can result in a slower connection.

**3. Configuration** 

Proxy IP is usually individually configured, which means that users must configure their proxy connection settings individually to direct traffic through the proxy. Until the user configures the proxy IP on the application, the application is not affected by proxying existing connections on the same device. Therefore users can use multiple proxy IPs on the same device for different operations.

VPNs are typically configured at the system level to allow all traffic to pass through, such as web browsing, music streaming, file sharing, and gaming. Many VPN software solutions allow users to exclude selected applications from running over the VPN, but the default settings usually direct all traffic through them.

**Summary** 

Overall, proxy IP and VPN differ in terms of security, speed, and configuration. Choosing between a proxy IP and a VPN depends on the user's own situation and purpose of use. Of course, whether you choose a proxy IP or VPN, you should get it through a safe and reliable channel to ensure the safety of your usage.
