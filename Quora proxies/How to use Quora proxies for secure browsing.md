<h3>Is Quora safe to use?</h3>

Quora is a useful knowledge and research tool for most adults to get more information. However anyone can answer questions on Quora, and there is no shortage of misinformation. For impressionable teenagers, it can have some bad effects if overused. Also, Quora's user data can be hacked and is not absolutely safe.
