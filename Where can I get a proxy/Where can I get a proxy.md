<h3>What is Proxy IP?</h3>

Before we get to the proxy, let's talk about IP addresses.IP addresses a string of numbers that uniquely identifies a device on a network. Your device has an IP address, and when you surf the Internet, the target website can be recognized. A proxy is a type of proxy server that can act as an intermediary between your device and the Internet, and it can accept and process your requests on behalf of your device.

<h3>How does Proxy IP work?</h3>

When you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, the whole process becomes safe and fast. First, your web request is not sent directly to the target website, but is first directed to a proxy server for routing. This step is the heart of the proxy server's work, and it acts as a bridge between you and the Internet.

Next, the proxy server forwards these requests from you to the target website without error. Once the request is received and processed by the target site, it returns the requested data to the proxy server, which in turn passes it on to your device. This process not only ensures the smooth delivery of requests, but also cleverly hides your true identity and location. Because of this process, the requests received by the target site appear to come from the proxy server itself, not your direct device. In this way, your real IP address will be hidden, and you can browse the web with peace of mind without worrying about the leakage of your personal privacy.
