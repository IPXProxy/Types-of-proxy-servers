# How do companies get residential proxies?
If you use your company's IP address for web operations, such as data scraping, a website can recognize and tag your IP address and block you from further actions. Residential proxies were developed in response to companies' need for enhanced anonymity and the ability to bypass blocking. So how do companies get residential proxies?

<h3>What are the types of residential proxies?</h3>

Residential proxies can be categorized into several types based on their function, purpose and connection management strategy, with different types of residential proxies being suitable for different use cases:

**Rotating Residential Proxies:** The most popular choice for organizations is rotating residential proxies. These proxies automatically rotate IP addresses at predetermined intervals or with each new request, making them difficult to track and block. They are ideal for price monitoring, ad verification, SEO monitoring, and other tasks that require a high degree of anonymity.

**Static Residential Proxies:** Static residential proxies are assigned a single IP address that remains consistent over time. This ensures a stable online presence for campaigns where changing IP addresses can lead to complications. They are a prime choice for brand protection, social media management, and application testing.

**Shared Residential Proxy:** Shared residential proxies can be used by multiple users simultaneously. This type of solution is usually cheaper and, therefore, weaker in terms of privacy protection and reliability. Shared residential proxies are used for less demanding web crawling operations and content streaming.

**Dedicated residential proxies:** Dedicated residential proxies belong to only one user. They offer privacy, security, and greater reliability because the user has full control over how the proxy IP is used. Dedicated residential proxies excel in a wide range of tasks that require anonymity, from e-commerce research to social media management and automation.

<h3>How do companies get residential proxies?</h3>

There are two main ways for companies to get residential proxies: free residential proxies and residential proxies service providers. The following is a detailed analysis of these two ways:

**Free Residential Proxies**
Free residential proxies do not require payment, but they are of poor quality. The number of residential IP addresses offered by free residential proxies is limited and there is a big gap compared to professional proxy service providers. For companies, it is not recommended to use free residential proxies found randomly on the web. Not only are they susceptible to malicious attacks that can threaten an organization's network security, but their speed and connection stability are also difficult to guarantee, which may negatively impact an organization's operational efficiency.

**Residential Proxy Service Providers**
Residential proxy service providers can offer high-quality residential proxies for companies. When choosing residential proxies, businesses can compare the features and services offered by different providers in detail. In addition, some residential proxy service providers are able to provide customized services according to the actual needs of enterprises and may offer corresponding price concessions, thus helping enterprises to effectively reduce operational costs.

If your company relies on residential proxies for network operations, you can get proxies from a residential proxy service provider.
