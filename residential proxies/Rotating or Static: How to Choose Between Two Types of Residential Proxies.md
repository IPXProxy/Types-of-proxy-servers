Residential proxies are one of the more commonly used proxy services, and they use the residential IPs of real users, which are more secure, reliable and effective in avoiding website monitoring. However, to better apply residential proxies to your work or life, you also need to find the type of residential proxy that best meets your needs, including rotating residential proxies and static residential proxies. Different types of residential proxies have their own features and advantages. So how do you choose right residential proxies?

<h3>Rotating Residential Proxies</h3>
Rotating residential proxies are the only residential proxy type that offers IP rotation. Their IPs change frequently, usually after each request or a set period, making you look like a new user whenever you access the same site. This way, itâ€™s harder for site servers to detect and block you.Some rotating residential proxy services offer sticky sessions as well, allowing you to hold the same IP for a certain period. This functionality is essential for social media management, web scraping, web testing, and similar tasks.

<h3>Static Residential Proxies</h3>
Static residential proxies are proxy server that assigns an IP address to the user for a specified period. This IP address comes from an Internet service provider (ISP) and is associated with a physical location. Because IP addresses come from real ISPs and are associated with a residential location, they are less likely to be flagged or blocked by websites, providing a more authentic browsing experience. 

<h3>When to Use Static vs Rotating Residential Proxies</h3>
The main difference between static proxies and rotating residential proxies is the nature of its IP address. The choice between static and rotating proxies ultimately depends on your specific needs.
