<h3>Can a proxy hide my IP address?</h3>

The main reason people use proxy servers is to hide their IP addresses. All of your Internet activity will go through a proxy server so that your own IP address will be hidden from prying eyes. Using a proxy server also increases security because it adds an extra layer of protection against hackers. If you want to browse the Internet anonymously, using a proxy server is one of the best ways to hide your identity.

<h3>Can my IP be tracked if I use a proxy?</h3>

While a proxy server can effectively mask your IP address, making it appear as though internet traffic originates from a different location, it doesn't guarantee total anonymity. If the proxy server's logs are accessed, your activities could potentially be traced back to your original IP address. 

Additionally, certain types of proxy servers do not fully hide the original IP address. Therefore, while proxies increase privacy, they don't provide absolute protection against all tracking methods. Below are some specific types of proxies:

**Anonymous Proxy**: An anonymous proxy hides the user's real IP address and helps you access websites anonymously. This type of proxy provides some anonymity so that your real IP is not recognized, but the presence of the proxy may be detected.

**Transparent proxies**: Transparent proxies are primarily used to centralize network traffic, usually in an internal corporate network setup, to monitor and control net traffic. These types of proxies do not provide anonymity and are therefore easily recognized.

**Residential proxies**: Residential proxies use real IP addresses with a high degree of anonymity and are typically used to bypass restrictions and enhance user privacy. With this type of proxy, your IP address is not easily recognized. It can simulate the behavior of real users and can effectively protect users' information security.

**Datacenter proxies:** A datacenter proxy is not associated with an Internet server, but with a separate organization through a data center. This type of proxy is highly anonymous and fast, but it is easily recognized by the target website.

In summary, proxies can hide your real IP and protect your privacy and security, but they don't exactly guarantee that your IP won't be traced. To prevent your IP address from being traced, you can use proxy types with more anonymity and security, such as anonymous proxies and residential proxies.
