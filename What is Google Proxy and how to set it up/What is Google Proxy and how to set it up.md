**DataCenter Google proxy**

A datacenter proxy is less costly than a residential proxy. It is less anonymous and less secure because its IP address comes from a data center and does not look like a regular user. Datacenter Google proxy is usually used by people for web scraping proxy, ad verification, and price comparison.
