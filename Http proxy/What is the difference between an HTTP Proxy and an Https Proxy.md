There are many types of proxy servers, and different types of proxy servers can meet different needs of users. HTTP proxy and HTTPS proxy are two common proxy types. People use proxies to improve security or anonymously access the Internet. While some people are confused about HTTP proxy and HTTPS proxy, let's understand the difference between HTTP proxy and HTTPS proxy.

<h3>What is HTTP proxy?</h3>
The HTTP proxy is a server that sits between your device and the Internet. When you make a request to access a website, the request goes through an HTTP proxy server. The proxy server forwards your request to the destination server. Once the destination server responds, the proxy server sends the data back to you, completing the TCP connection.HTTP proxies are a subset of the various proxy types available, which run on application layer protocols and are specialized for handling HTTP traffic.

<h3>What is HTTPS proxy?</h3>
The HTTPS proxy is a more secure version of the HTTP proxy. With the HTTPS proxy, you don't send requests to the server through the proxy. Instead, the proxy creates a TCP connection that implements end-to-end encryption, significantly improving security. All traffic is encrypted except for the data required for routing.

<h3>Difference between HTTP Proxy and HTTPS Proxy</h3>

The difference between an HTTP proxy and an HTTPS proxy is that they communicate in different ways, and an HTTPS proxy has an enhanced security layer, the SSL layer, which encrypts your data and makes it more secure than an HTTP proxy. Below is a breakdown of the differences between the two proxies to help users decide which one to use.

**1. Speed** 

HTTP proxies are usually faster because they don't encrypt your data. They can process network traffic faster and provide good loading speeds for activities such as web browsing or streaming media. HTTPS proxies, on the other hand, encrypt your data, and the encryption and decryption process affects loading speeds, which can slow down TCP connections slightly.

**2. Security** 

HTTP proxies lack secure connections, making them vulnerable to various security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. They do not provide an additional layer of security, which makes them less suitable for handling sensitive information. HTTPS proxies provide a layer of security through SSL encryption. This secure connection ensures that your data is encrypted, greatly reducing the risk of malicious activity or data interception by an unauthorized party.

**3. Anonymization** 
While HTTP proxies can mask your real IP address, they do not encrypt your data. Your online activity can still be tracked by your ISP or any potential eavesdropper. HTTPS proxies not only mask your IP address, but also encrypt your data, providing a higher level of anonymity. This makes it much more difficult for anyone to track your online activity or intercept sensitive information.

Through the above comparison, I believe you already know the difference between HTTP proxy and HTTPS proxy, you can choose the right proxy according to your own needs. If you want speed and ease of operation, it is recommended to use an HTTP proxy. If you need a high level of anonymity, HTTPS proxy is a better choice.
