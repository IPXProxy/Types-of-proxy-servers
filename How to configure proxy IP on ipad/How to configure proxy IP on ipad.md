# How to configure proxy IP on ipad?
When we are travelling around the Internet on iPad and eager to explore more resources, adopting proxy IP becomes a practical choice. It not only opens up an unprecedented experience for iPad users, but also demonstrates significant advantages in protecting personal privacy and security as well as breaking through geographical restrictions to access content. So, how to easily set up proxy IP on iPad to unlock these convenient features? The next steps will guide you to master this new skill.

<h3>What is Proxy IP?</h3>
Proxy IP, in short, is an intermediary server that hides the real IP address of iPad. Once you have configured a proxy IP on your iPad, when you visit a website, all requests will first be forwarded through this proxy server without revealing your real IP address. Proxy IP not only ensures the security of data transmission, but also effectively prevents the leakage of personal information, providing an extra layer of protection for your online activities.

<h3>How to turn off the Proxy IP on ipad?</h3>
While configuring a proxy IP on your iPad is a simple and useful process, it's just as convenient to turn it off if you decide you no longer need the proxy service. Simply follow similar steps as you did when configuring the proxy earlier, but choose to turn off the proxy in the final step. Once the proxy IP is turned off, your iPad will communicate directly with the network via its original IP address and will no longer forward requests through the proxy server.
