**Before you learn about Socks5 proxy, you need to know what a proxy server is and how it works:** 
<h3>What is a proxy server?</h3>
A proxy server is a computer that sits between you and a server and acts as a gateway between your local network and the Internet. Proxy servers work by intercepting connections between senders and receivers, and in addition to traffic forwarding, they increase security by hiding the actual IP address of the server. Proxy servers can also encrypt your data, making it unreadable in transit, and block access to certain web pages based on IP address.

<h3>What is Socks5 proxy?</h3>
SOCKS5 is an Internet protocol that transmits network traffic through a remote server. A Socks5 proxy server establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to another server behind a firewall on behalf of a client. Then exchanges network packets between the client and the actual server. The SOCKS proxy changes the IP address associated with these packets before they reach their final destination, providing enhanced online security. The SOCKS proxy server changes the IP addresses associated with these packets before they reach their final destination, providing greater online anonymity.

<h3>Socks5 proxy application scenarios</h3>
Compared to other proxy protocols, Socks5 proxy offers higher performance and better security. It suitable for a wider range of application scenarios.

**Secure connection** 
Socks5 proxy can encrypt transmission data to ensure information security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks, it can more effectively protect sensitive information.

**Web crawlers** 
For enterprises and research institutions that need a lot of data, SOCKS5 proxy is an indispensable tool. It can help web crawlers bypass IP restrictions and obtain the required data without being blocked by the target website.

**Streaming services** 
For streaming media users, SOCKS5 proxies can break through geographical restrictions and access more content. For example, users can watch Netflix programs in other countries through SOCKS5 proxies and enjoy more film and television resources.

The Socks5 proxy service not only solves challenges such as geographic limitations but also helps individuals and organizations improve privacy and security and achieve anonymity online.
