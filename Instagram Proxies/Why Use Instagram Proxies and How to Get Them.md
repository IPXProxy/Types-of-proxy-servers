<h3>Why Instagram is blocked</h3>

Like many other social media platforms, Instagram can be blocked for a variety of reasons, two of which are common: network restrictions and content blocking.

Network restrictions occur when the network you are connected to, such as your workplace or school, decides to limit access to certain websites or applications. This is often done to maintain productivity or prevent inappropriate content from being accessed.

Content blocking occurs when your local government or Internet Service Provider (ISP) decides to restrict access to Instagram for censorship or regulatory reasons. This can be frustrating for users who rely on Instagram for personal or professional use.

There's also a possibility that you've been blocked because you've violated Instagram's Terms of Service in the course of your use. This includes things like using bots for automated activities or data scraping.

Quality proxies offer a wide range of server locations, allowing you to access Instagram from all over the world, which is especially useful if you want to view content that is limited to a specific country, or if you are traveling and need to bypass local restrictions.
